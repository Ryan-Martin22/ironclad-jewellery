# About
This is a full-stack e-commerce project built using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have created this website for 'Ironclad', a business that sells a range
of Men's Jewellery of all differnt stylings, including gold,silver and stainless steel. This site exclusively sells rings and bracelets. 

# User Experience

# Strategy

This website is for a Business to Consumer (B2C) business that sells stylish men's jewellery. The target market for these products are:

- Men who enjoy fashion and in particular, mens's jewellery.
- Those looking for gifts or presents for people who enjoy wearing jewellery.
- Men aged between 15 and 60.

Keeping the above in mind, I believe the Customers will need a website that is:

- Easy to Navigate and filter/search by category.

- Has the ability to view and purchase items.

- Has an email subscription service.

- Has links to Social Media sites Facebook and Instagram.

- User Account functionality, to keep track of order history and store delivery information.

And the Owner will need a website that:

- Appealingly displays their products.

- Allows them to add, edit and remove products.

- Allows customers to get in contact if required through a contact form.

- Allows user to share feedback through reviews on products in order to improve products/service.

- Site Navigation containing a Search Bar, My Account Links, Shopping Bag links, Contact Us form and Product Categories sections.

- A Landing Page that clearly demonstrates what the site is for.

- A Products Page that lists the Products contained within the category/search carried out.

- Products Cards that gives the user an image of the product along with name, price, and ability to click into it for more details.

- Registration/login functionality using Django AllAuth so that users can create and manage their account.

- A User Profile Page so that users can save delivery details for faster orders in future and to see their order history.

- Custom 404 Error Page

# Structure

This project is structured with a homepage that greets the user with a clear navigation bar at the top of the page to search for the item required or to browse all products. There is the ability to sort items by price, alphabetically, and by category as well as the ability to search for a product by typing keywords into the search bar.

The website is made of the following apps:
1. Home
2. Products
3. Profile
4. Bag
5. Checkout
6. Contact
7. Favourites

## Database Models 

### Category

The Category model is required so that the site owner can assign products to a Category. This model allows for filtering functionality so that shoppers can search for items wanted by item type, new arrivals, clearance, and deals.

### Products
The Products model is required to add products for sale to the site. The site owner only can add, edit, and delete products from here and all users can view the full product list on the site.

### Order & Order Line Items
The Order model holds the order details of an order placed by the shoppers. This is connected to the Order Line Items model which contains the products ordered by the shopper.

### User Profile

The User Profile contains delivery information for those who created an account and chose to store their delivery details for faster checkout.

### Favourites

The Favourites model is required for users to add products to their favourites so they can come back to purchases them later.

### Contact

The Contact model enables users to provide information in order for them to contact the store owner about a specific query. 

### Review 

The reviews database holds all of the reviews submitted by users with an account. Users can submit, edit and delete reviews posted by themselves whilst logged in to their accounts. This is accessible via the Product Details page for the products they have reviewed.

## Wireframes

All wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

Ironclad Jewellery Wireframes for Mobile, Tablet and Desktop devices can be viewed in the wirefames folder within the assets folder.
