# About
This is a full-stack e-commerce project built using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have created this website for 'Ironclad', a business that sells a range
of Men's Jewellery of all differnt stylings, including gold,silver and stainless steel. This site exclusively sells rings and bracelets. 

# User Experience

# Strategy

This website is for a Business to Consumer (B2C) business that sells stylish men's jewellery. The target market for these products are:

- Men who enjoy fashion and in particular, mens's jewellery.
- Those looking for gifts or presents for people who enjoy wearing jewellery.
- Men aged between 15 and 60.

Keeping the above in mind, I believe the Customers will need a website that is:

- Easy to Navigate and filter/search by category.

- Has the ability to view and purchase items.

- Has an email subscription service.

- Has links to Social Media sites Facebook and Instagram.

- User Account functionality, to keep track of order history and store delivery information.

And the Owner will need a website that:

- Appealingly displays their products.

- Allows them to add, edit and remove products.

- Allows customers to get in contact if required through a contact form.

- Allows user to share feedback through reviews on products in order to improve products/service.

# Scope

To achieve the above user and business goals, this project will be created with the following features:

- Site Navigation containing a Search Bar, My Account Links, Shopping Bag links, Contact Us form and Product Categories sections.

- A Landing Page that clearly demonstrates what the site is for.

- A Products Page that lists the Products contained within the category/search carried out.

- Products Cards that gives the user an image of the product along with name, price, and ability to click into it for more details.

- Registration/login functionality using Django AllAuth so that users can create and manage their account.

- A User Profile Page so that users can save delivery details for faster orders in future and to see their order history.

- Custom 404 Error Page

# Structure

This project is structured with a homepage that greets the user with a clear navigation bar at the top of the page to search for the item required or to browse all products. There is the ability to sort items by price, alphabetically, and by category as well as the ability to search for a product by typing keywords into the search bar.

The website is made of the following apps:
1. Home
2. Products
3. Profile
4. Bag
5. Checkout
6. Contact
7. Favourites

## Database Models 

### Category

The Category model is required so that the site owner can assign products to a Category. This model allows for filtering functionality so that shoppers can search for items wanted by item type, new arrivals, clearance, and deals.

### Products
The Products model is required to add products for sale to the site. The site owner only can add, edit, and delete products from here and all users can view the full product list on the site.

### Order & Order Line Items
The Order model holds the order details of an order placed by the shoppers. This is connected to the Order Line Items model which contains the products ordered by the shopper.

### User Profile

The User Profile contains delivery information for those who created an account and chose to store their delivery details for faster checkout.

### Favourites

The Favourites model is required for users to add products to their favourites so they can come back to purchases them later.

### Contact

The Contact model enables users to provide information in order for them to contact the store owner about a specific query. 

### Review 

The reviews database holds all of the reviews submitted by users with an account. Users can submit, edit and delete reviews posted by themselves whilst logged in to their accounts. This is accessible via the Product Details page for the products they have reviewed.

## Wireframes

All wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

Ironclad Jewellery Wireframes for Mobile, Tablet and Desktop devices can be viewed in the wirefames folder within the assets folder.

# Testing
## **Manual Testing by User Story**
### **Superuser / Admin**
### 1. As a Site Owner, I want to be able to add a product so that I can add more items to my store.
- Products can be added both via the project management page found by clicking on 'My Account' or vis the Admin Panel. Both types of product adding were tested and the products were both visable in the model and on the Products Page.

The following was also checked and found to be working as expected when the product was added:

- The required fields are validating correctly and error messages are explicit and related to each required field.
- All required fields are indicated with an asterisk.
- Number fields can only contain numbers.
- Images can be left out and a placeholder image takes its place.
- Images, when uploaded, are stored in the appropriate Amazon Web Services Bucket and Folder.
- Buttons are highlighted on hover and take the user to the correct page:
    - Cancel takes the user back to the Products Page
    - Add product add the product and returns the user to the Products Page
- An alert message appears in the top right of the page to notify the user that the product has successfully been added.

### 2.	As a Site Owner, I want to be able to Edit/Update a product so that I can change the price, description, and other product criteria.

The below was tested by editing an existing product:

- Edit buttons are located on the product cards on the products page which are only accessible if you are a Superuser. 

I also attempted to edit products whilst signed in as a generic user. The edit button on the Product Cards weren't available and I was unable to sign into the Admin Panel.

- Clicking the Edit button takes the user to the product form which is already populated with the current information. I double checked this information matched the product I intended to edit, which it did. 
- The fields are validated the same way as if a new product was being added, all number fields must be numbers and required fields filled in. Error messages appeared as I attempted to input incorrect information and the form would not submit.
- Removing the image was tested and the placeholder image will replaced it upon saving as expected.
- If the image is replaced with a new image it is stored in the correct Amazon Web Services Bucket and Folder.
- The name of the image uploaded can be the same as an image that exists.
- An alert message appears in the top right of the page to notify the user which product they are currently editing. This matched the product name that was populated within the edit form.
- Buttons are highlighted on hover and take the user to the correct page:
    - Cancel takes the user back to the Products Page.
    - Update product saves the updated product information and returns the user to the Products Page. This is confirmed via the admin panel and the details on the Product Details page.


### 3.	As a Site Owner, I want to be able to delete a product so that I can remove items that are no longer available.

The following was tested by deleting a Product via the delete button on the Product Card:
- Clicking delete took the user to a Delete Confirmation Page. 
- Confirming delete removes the product from the product model and is no longer available to buy via the Products Page.
- The user cannot view the product with the URL. Using the link for a product that no longer exists takes the user to a 404 error page.
- A success message at the top right of the page confirms the product is successfully deleted.

### 4.	As a Site Owner, I want to be able to send emails to customers with a subscription, notifying customers of any deals, sale and new arrivals.

- Customers who sign up for emails are added to the business's Mailchimp contacts list where they can be unsubscribed. Users can contact the owner via the 'contact us' form in the footer to unsubscribe. 

This was tested by subscribing with an email and checking the email list on Mailchimp to ensure it was submitted. I also check the unsubscribe functionality to ensure it was easy to remove an email from the email list.

- Unsubscribed users can re-subscribe by submitting their email again. This was tested by unsubscribing an email and then re-subscribing. The re-subscribed email is back in the email list as subscribed.

- An error message is displayed underneath the email box if there is an issue with the email provided. I attempted to subscribe with test@test.com, a message appeared underneath stating that I could not subscribe with this email.
- A success message is displayed underneath the email box to confirm the subscription. I tested this by submitting a valid email that exists. A success message appeared underneath, thanking the user for subscribing.


### 5.	As a Site Owner, I want to be able to remove reviews from the site without deleting them so that they can still be available if required.

- Status Field in Admin Panel

Within the Admin panel, the Superuser is able to remove a review from the site without deleting it by un-ticking the status checkbox within the review. This was tested by un-checking the status box on one of the submitted reviews. I then went to the product the review was for to check whether the review was still posted on the Product Details page. The review was removed without being deleted and the total count of review decreased.

### **Shopper**
### 1. As a Shopper, I want to be able to view a list of items so that I can add them to my basket.

- All products are displayed using Bootstrap Cards and Responsiveness classes to ensure the card layout changes dependant on screen size. I tested this by comparing the model with the products displayed on the site. The number of products matched along with the details of the products listed. 

- Products can be viewed together or by category and can be further filtered using the sort box on the top right of the products pages. This was tested by clicking through each category and sort to check the products listed match the filter that was in place. Categories matched categories without missing items, and the sort filtered the products in the order specified by the user.

- All product images are displayed and where they do not exist there is a placeholder. This was tested by adding a product without an image to see what happens when submitted. The placeholder image was in place as expected and when edited the image was replaced with a product image.

- All products have a required title, price and category attached to the product card. This was tested by trying to submit a new product without this information included individually. When either of these fields are missing, the form validation prevents the form from submitting until the fields are completed.

- Edit and Delete buttons are unavailable to non-superusers. This was tested by signing in as a generic user. When navigating to the products the edit and delete buttons are unavailable and the user was unable to access the Admin Panel to edit/delete the product from there.

###	2. As a shopper, I want to be able to click into an item so that I can view a product description and add to the basket.

I tested this by: 
- Clicking a Product Card. I was taken to the correct item as the product image, title, and price matched the Product Card clicked on. The user can also see the description of the item they are viewing which matched the description in the model for that product. 

### 3. As a shopper, I want to be able to add items to my basket so that I can keep track of what I am spending.

The following scenarios were tested by checking the items added to the Shopping Bag:

- I added an item to the bag and checked the correct product was added.

- I increased the quantity before adding to the shopping bag and checked whether the quantity in the bag matched what was was added.

- I tried to add 0 or a quantity over 99, an error message by the quantity field notifies the user that the quantity can only be between 1-99. If the user uses the buttons rather than typing the quantity, the buttons are disabled if attempting to decrement to 0 or increment above 99. I was unable to add a quantity that wasn't within the specified quantity allowance.

- Once an item has been added to the shopping bag a success message appears in the top right corning, notifying the user of the specific product and quantity added, how much more to spend to save on delivery and a link to the shopping bag. The product in the toast matched the Product Details I was in and the item that was in the shopping bag.

All items were added as they should be to the shopping bag and tested through to order completion to ensure the items added to the shopping bag matched the completed order.
