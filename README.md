# About
This is a full-stack e-commerce project built using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have created this website for 'Ironclad', a business that sells a range
of Men's Jewellery of all differnt stylings, including gold,silver and stainless steel. This site exclusively sells rings and bracelets. 

# User Experience

# Strategy

This website is for a Business to Consumer (B2C) business that sells stylish men's jewellery. The target market for these products are:

- Men who enjoy fashion and in particular, mens's jewellery.
- Those looking for gifts or presents for people who enjoy wearing jewellery.
- Men aged between 15 and 60.

Keeping the above in mind, I believe the Customers will need a website that is:

- Easy to Navigate and filter/search by category.

- Has the ability to view and purchase items.

- Has an email subscription service.

- Has links to Social Media sites Facebook and Instagram.

- User Account functionality, to keep track of order history and store delivery information.

And the Owner will need a website that:

- Appealingly displays their products.

- Allows them to add, edit and remove products.

- Allows customers to get in contact if required through a contact form.

- Allows user to share feedback through reviews on products in order to improve products/service.
